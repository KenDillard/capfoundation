# Who We Are

We are the CAP Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) the leading organization of board-certified pathologists. We provide pathologist-led, life-saving cervical and breast cancer screening to underserved women in the US. Our grant and award opportunities prepare pathology residents and fellows to meet medicine's challenges, to enhance their training in laboratory quality, applied technology, science, and research.
